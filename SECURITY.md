# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub Issues.** We use GitHub's **Private Vulnerability Reporting** system to keep our users safe while we develop a fix. To report a vulnerability:

1. On the main page of this repository, click **Security**.
2. On the left sidebar, under "Reporting", click **Advisories**.
3. Click **Report a vulnerability**.
4. Fill out the details (description, steps to reproduce, and potential impact).

We will review your report and get back to you through the private advisory thread as soon as possible.

## Our Commitment

- **Responsible Disclosure:** We aim to acknowledge all reports within 48 hours.
- **Credit:** We are happy to credit researchers for their discoveries in our release notes (unless you prefer to stay anonymous).
- **Safe Harbor:** We will not pursue legal action against anyone who acts in good faith and follows this policy.
