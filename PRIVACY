Privacy Policy
--------------

Last Updated: February 27, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how this service processes information when users send messages through the application.
The service is designed with privacy-by-design principles and minimizes the collection and retention of personal data.

1. Data Transmission & IP Addresses
    To facilitate standard internet communication, your IP address is visible to our hosting provider (Render) to route messages back to your device.
        Application Invisibility: Our server application is designed so that it does not see, log, or store your public IP address, even in a hashed
                                  or pseudonymized format.
        No Permanent Identifiers (Standard Mode): For unverified users, we do not use cookies or permanent tokens. The server identifies you using a 
                                  temporary guest label derived from your current WebSocket connection port.
        Transient Identity: For guest users, this label is strictly temporary; it changes every time you reconnect to the server. Users can manually 
                            trigger a reconnection and rotate their label at any time by using the '/rc' command within the client.
        Open Source: Users may review the code to see exactly what data is processed and how it is handled at https://github.com/AlinaWan/RobloxChatLauncher.

2. Optional Roblox Account Verification
    Verification is a completely optional feature. We aim to ensure that users do not have to verify to access features that do not 
    fundamentally require identity confirmation.
        Hardware Identifiers: If you choose to verify your Roblox account via the profile blurb method, the application generates a Machine 
                              GUID (Hardware ID) on your local device. This ID is used to link your local installation to your Roblox 
                              User ID in our database.
        Storage & Persistence: If verified, your Hardware ID and associated Roblox User ID are stored in a persistent PostgreSQL database to 
                               recognize your account across sessions.
        No IP Logging: Even during verification, we do not log or store your IP address. The system relies solely on the Hardware ID provided 
                       by your device and the public data provided by the Roblox API.
        Right to Erasure: You may invoke your "Right to be Forgotten" at any time by running the '/unverify' command within the client. Executing
                          this command sends an immediate deletion request to our server, which permanently purges your Hardware ID and linked
                          Roblox User ID from our database and clears all associated data from your local device.

3. Message Content & Content Moderation
    Messages submitted to the service are processed for the purpose of maintaining a safe and abuse-free environment. To assist with
    content moderation, message text is analyzed using the Perspective API. The service enables Google's doNotStore option, which
    instructs Google not to retain submitted message text or use it for model training after analysis.
    Users are encouraged to review Google's Privacy Policy at https://policies.google.com/privacy.

4. Hosting & Infrastructure
    This service is hosted on Render. As a hosting provider, Render may automatically collect and retain access logs (such as IP addresses and
    timestamps) for security and operational monitoring. In addition, the application may temporarily log messages and technical metadata for
    debugging and moderation purposes. Message content may appear transiently within the application logs as part of normal request handling.
        Retention: Render automatically deletes the application logs after approximately 7 days. The application itself does not persist or store
                   message content, chat history, or user-submitted messages outside of Render’s standard logging systems. The service does not have the
                   ability to access, retrieve, or restore message content once Render’s logs are deleted.
    Users should avoid including personally identifiable or sensitive information in messages, as message content is user-submitted
    and cannot be guaranteed to remain private once transmitted.
    Users are encouraged to review Render's Privacy Policy at https://render.com/privacy.

5. Limited Personal Data Processing
    The service is built on a "zero-account" model. We do not collect names, emails, or credentials.
        What the Server Sees: Your submitted message content, the specific channel/instance it is routed to, and (if verified) your Roblox User ID.
        Temporary Metadata: For guest users, the server tracks active connections via ephemeral port numbers. Because these ports are reused by 
                            the operating system across different users over time, they cannot be used as a reliable or permanent identifier 
                            for any specific individual.
        Verification: For verified users, we maintain a link between your Hardware ID and Roblox ID. For unverified users, we generally cannot 
                      link a specific message to a specific person once the connection is closed.
    All processing is limited to what is necessary for service operation, security, and abuse prevention.

6. Legal Basis & Consent
    GDPR / UK GDPR
        Where applicable, personal data is processed under Article 6(1)(f) (legitimate interests) for ensuring service security, preventing abuse,
        and maintaining system integrity. Pursuant to Article 11 GDPR, we do not require, and do not collect, additional information to identify 
        users who choose not to use the optional verification feature.
            Rights Limitations: We process only messages and transient logs for guest users, and are generally not in a position to identify 
                                specific data subjects. Therefore, the rights of access, rectification, erasure, and portability (Articles 15–20) 
                                do not apply unless you are a verified user or provide additional information that enables your identification.
            Right to Complain: Regardless of identification, you maintain the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
    PIPEDA (Canada)
        Personal data is processed with implied consent for the limited purpose of service security. In accordance with PIPEDA's principle of limited
        collection, we do not associate technical identifiers with specific individuals unless verification is voluntarily initiated. We reserve the 
        right to refuse access requests where the information cannot be reasonably associated with the requester without the collection of 
        additional personal data.
    CCPA / CPRA (California)
        The service does not sell, rent, or share personal information as defined by the CCPA/CPRA. Personal information is processed solely to operate
        and secure the service. We do not sell or share your personal information for cross-contextual behavioral advertising.
            Notice at Collection: We collect message content and (optionally) hardware identifiers for security purposes. We do not sell or share this information.
            Verifiable Requests: California residents have the right to request deletion or access. However, we can only fulfill requests that are Verifiable.
                                 As we do not maintain traditional accounts, we may not be able to verify requests from unverified users. 

7. International Data Transfers
    This service is hosted on servers located in the United States (via Render). When you use the service, your data is transferred to and processed in the
    U.S. We ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring that our sub-processors (Render and Google) utilize standard contractual
    clauses (SCCs) or other legally recognized transfer mechanisms approved by the European Commission.

8. California Privacy Rights
    California residents have the right to request:
        - The categories of personal information processed
        - The purposes for which personal information is used
        - Access, correction, and deletion of personal information, subject to technical and legal limitations
    Non-Discrimination: We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. To exercise your rights, please contact us at the
                        email provided in Section 9.
    The service does not engage in targeted advertising, profiling, or data sales, and therefore does not offer opt-out mechanisms for sale or
    sharing of personal data. Deletion requests apply to data under the service’s direct control. Certain technical logs managed by infrastructure
    providers may be retained for a limited period and deleted automatically in accordance with their retention policies.

9. Contact & Privacy Inquiries
    The Data Controller for this service is the operator of the RobloxChatLauncher project. For the purposes of PIPEDA, the operator also serves as
    the Privacy Officer. If you have questions or wish to challenge our compliance with these principles, please contact:
        Email: Xelvanta@proton.me

10. Policy Updates
    This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Changes take effect immediately upon posting. Users are encouraged to review this
    policy periodically for updates.
