Privacy
-------

To send a message to the demo server, your client's IP address is automatically include in the HTTP request.
This is a normal part of how the web works and is required for routing the response back to your device.  

The server temporarily uses your IP only to enforce rate limits and echo the message back to you.  
IP addresses are NEVER stored, shared, or used for any other purpose.  

Because the server is hosted on Render, the hosting provider may log access metadata according to its own policies.
Users are encouraged to review Render's privacy policy at https://render.com/privacy for more information.

No other personal information is collected by this app.
