Privacy Policy
--------------

Last Updated: January 6, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how this service processes information when users send messages through the application.
The service is designed with privacy-by-design principles and minimizes the collection and retention of personal data.

1. Data Transmission & IP Addresses
    When a message is sent to the server, the user's IP address is automatically included in the HTTP request. This is a
    fundamental requirement of standard internet communication. IP addresses are used only for the following purposes:
        Routing: Delivering responses back to the user's device.
        Security: Enforcing rate limits to prevent service abuse.
    Raw IP addresses are not stored by the application. Users may review the code to see exactly what data is processed and
    how it is handled at https://github.com/AlinaWan/RobloxChatLauncher.

2. Message Content & Content Moderation
    Messages submitted to the service are processed for the purpose of maintaining a safe and abuse-free environment. To assist with
    content moderation, message text is analyzed using the Perspective API. The service enables Google's doNotStore option, which
    instructs Google not to retain submitted message text or use it for model training after analysis.
    Users are encouraged to review Google's Privacy Policy at https://policies.google.com/privacy.

3. Hosting & Infrastructure
    This service is hosted on Render. As a hosting provider, Render may automatically collect and retain access logs (such as IP addresses and
    timestamps) for security and operational monitoring. In addition, the application may temporarily log messages and technical metadata for
    debugging and moderation purposes. Message content may appear transiently within Render’s infrastructure logs as part of normal request handling.
        Retention: Render automatically deletes infrastructure logs after approximately 7 days. The application itself does not persist or store
        message content, chat history, or user-submitted messages outside of Render’s standard logging systems. The service does not have the
        ability to access, retrieve, or restore message content once Render’s logs are deleted.
    Users should avoid including personally identifiable or sensitive information in messages, as message content is user-submitted
    and cannot be guaranteed to remain private once transmitted.
    Users are encouraged to review Render's Privacy Policy at https://render.com/privacy.

4. Limited Personal Data Processing
    The service does not offer user accounts and does not collect names, email addresses, or account credentials.
        The only personal data processed is:
            - IP addresses transmitted as part of standard HTTP communication (used only transiently for routing and security; not stored by the service)
            - Message content voluntarily submitted by users.
    All processing is limited to what is necessary for service operation, security, and abuse prevention.

5. Legal Basis & Consent
    GDPR / UK GDPR
        Where applicable, personal data is processed under Article 6(1)(f) (legitimate interests) for ensuring service security, preventing abuse,
        and maintaining system integrity. Pursuant to Article 11 GDPR, we do not require, and do not collect, additional information to identify users.
            Rights Limitations: We process only messages and transient logs, and are generally not in a position to identify specific data
                                subjects. Therefore, the rights of access, rectification, erasure, and portability (Articles 15–20) do not apply
                                unless you provide additional information that enables your identification.
            Right to Complain: Regardless of identification, you maintain the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
    PIPEDA (Canada)
        Personal data is processed with implied consent for the limited purpose of service security. In accordance with PIPEDA's principle of limited
        collection, we do not associate technical identifiers with specific individuals. We reserve the right to refuse access requests where the
        information cannot be reasonably associated with the requester without the collection of additional personal data.
    CCPA / CPRA (California)
        The service does not sell, rent, or share personal information as defined by the CCPA/CPRA. Personal information is processed solely to operate
        and secure the service. We do not sell or share your personal information for cross-contextual behavioral advertising.
            Notice at Collection: We collect message content for security purposes. We do not sell or share this information.
            Verifiable Requests: California residents have the right to request deletion or access. However, we can only fulfill requests that are Verifiable.
                                 As we do not maintain accounts, names, or emails, we may not be able to verify that the requester is the person who sent a
                                 specific message. We will not collect additional personal information solely for the purpose of verification.

6. International Data Transfers
    This service is hosted on servers located in the United States (via Render). When you use the service, your data is transferred to and processed in the
    U.S. We ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring that our sub-processors (Render and Google) utilize standard contractual
    clauses (SCCs) or other legally recognized transfer mechanisms approved by the European Commission.

7. California Privacy Rights
    California residents have the right to request:
        - The categories of personal information processed
        - The purposes for which personal information is used
        - Access, correction, and deletion of personal information, subject to technical and legal limitations
    Non-Discrimination: We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. To exercise your rights, please contact us at the
                        email provided in Section 8.
    The service does not engage in targeted advertising, profiling, or data sales, and therefore does not offer opt-out mechanisms for sale or
    sharing of personal data. Deletion requests apply to data under the service’s direct control. Certain technical logs managed by infrastructure
    providers may be retained for a limited period and deleted automatically in accordance with their retention policies.

8. Contact & Privacy Inquiries
    The Data Controller for this service is the operator of the RobloxChatLauncher project. For the purposes of PIPEDA, the operator also serves as
    the Privacy Officer. If you have questions or wish to challenge our compliance with these principles, please contact:
        Email: Xelvanta@proton.me

9. Policy Updates
    This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Changes take effect immediately upon posting. Users are encouraged to review this
    policy periodically for updates.
