1. Data Transmission & IP Addresses
    To send a message to the demo server, your client's IP address is automatically included in the HTTP request.
    This is a fundamental requirement of web communication. The server uses your IP address solely for:
        Routing: Sending the response back to your device.
        Security: Enforcing rate limits to prevent service abuse.
                  IP addresses are NEVER used for any other purpose.

2. Content Moderation (Perspective API)
    To maintain a safe environment, sent messages are analyzed for harmful content using the Perspective API.
        Privacy Measure: We specifically enable the "doNotStore" flag, which instructs Google to delete the message
                         text after analysis rather than using it for model training.
        Users are encouraged to review Google's Privacy Policy at https://policies.google.com/privacy.

3. Hosting & Infrastructure
    This service is hosted on Render. As a hosting provider, Render may automatically log access metadata
    (such as timestamps and IP addresses) for security and operational monitoring.
    Users are encouraged to review Render's Privacy Policy at https://render.com/privacy.

4. No Personal Data Collection
    Aside from the transient data mentioned above, this application does not collect, request, or store any personal
    information, account data, or chat history.
